MEPHAS, an open-source and free web-interactive platform, caters to the needs of statistical data analyses for researchers. 6MFSanova features an intuitive interface with distinct tabs for One-way ANOVA, Multiple Comparison for One-way ANOVA, Two-way ANOVA, Multiple Comparison for Two-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and Multiple Comparison for Kruskal-Wallis Test. Users can leverage this tool to determine if means significantly differ among factor groups, pairs, or after controlling for other factors. The application empowers researchers to explore interactions between factors and identify significant differences among pairs in various ANOVA scenarios.
